Things I do to to learn and for leisure :)

I'm a student currently undergoing and persuing a carreer on Data Science and Applied Mathematics in México at ITESM.
I like a lot programming and want to learn more things that apply to Data Science (mainly it) and Computer Science. Most of this little things I put up in this repository will be basic for the experienced in this fields. I´ll be just experimenting with some things I want to 
program. 
If some of you have some feedback that would help me on the process of persuing my carreer or tips for certain things, go ahead and comment me about so, as I´ll gladly read them and appreciate the gesture :D
